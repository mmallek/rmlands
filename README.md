Files associated with RMLands. Files on my computer include copies of the application, model files, gis data, parameter sets, etc. Probably this folder should be cleaned out. Files be pushed to git are the simple and low-memory files that I think it's worth to track with github. So, these include the csvs that accompany the gis data, the disturbance and succession rules, and the climate parameter inputs.
